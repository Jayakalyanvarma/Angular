# Top 10 Interview Questions on Angular Project Structure

## 1. What is the structure of an Angular project?

An Angular project is typically structured with various key directories and files:
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
- `app/`: Inside `src`, contains components, services, and modules.
- `assets/`: Stores static assets such as images or fonts.
- `environments/`: Contains environment-specific configuration files.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that Angular injects application content into.
- `angular.json`: The main configuration file for Angular CLI projects.
- `package.json`: Contains project dependencies and scripts.
- `main.ts`: The entry point of the application, bootstraps the Angular app.
- `polyfills.ts`: Provides compatibility with different browsers.
- `styles.css`: Global styles.

## 2. What is the purpose of `angular.json` in an Angular project?

The `angular.json` file is the Angular CLI configuration file. It defines how the application is built, where source files are located, which styles and scripts to include, and settings for production and development builds. It also specifies output paths, assets, and different environments.

## 3. Explain the purpose of `main.ts` and `polyfills.ts` in Angular.

- **`main.ts`**: This file is the entry point of the Angular application. It bootstraps the root module (usually `AppModule`) and starts the application.
- **`polyfills.ts`**: This file is used to provide support for older browsers by adding polyfills, which are scripts that ensure compatibility with missing features (like ES6 features not supported in IE).

## 4. What is the significance of `app.module.ts`?

The `app.module.ts` file defines the root module (`AppModule`) of an Angular application. It acts as the starting point for compiling and running the app by declaring all components, services, and dependencies that the application needs. It imports necessary Angular modules, declares app components, and bootstraps the root component.

## 5. What are feature modules in Angular, and why are they important?

Feature modules are Angular modules designed to organize code into cohesive blocks focused on specific features of an application. They are important because they enable modularity, code reuse, and lazy loading, improving maintainability and performance by only loading the necessary modules when needed.

---

## 6. How does Angular handle environment-specific settings?

Angular manages environment-specific settings using files under the `environments/` folder. Typically, you have:
- `environment.ts`: The default settings used in development mode.
- `environment.prod.ts`: Settings used in production mode.

In the `angular.json` configuration file, different build configurations can be set to replace the `environment.ts` file with `environment.prod.ts` (or other custom environments) during the build process.

---

## 7. What is the purpose of `assets/` in an Angular project?

The `assets/` directory is used to store static files such as images, fonts, and other resources that need to be served as part of the application. These files are included in the build output and can be referenced directly from the Angular app.

---

## 8. How does lazy loading work in Angular, and how is it implemented in project structure?

Lazy loading in Angular is a design pattern that allows feature modules to be loaded on demand rather than loading the entire application upfront. It’s implemented by using Angular’s `loadChildren` method in routing configuration (`app-routing.module.ts`), which defines when a module should be loaded:
```ts
{ path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }
```
This helps improve performance by reducing the initial bundle size.

---

## 9. What is the difference between `declarations`, `imports`, and `providers` in `NgModule`?

- **`declarations`**: Contains the components, directives, and pipes that belong to the module.
- **`imports`**: Specifies external modules that the current module depends on (such as `BrowserModule` or `FormsModule`).
- **`providers`**: Specifies the services and other dependencies that are available for dependency injection in the module.

---

## 10. What is the purpose of `shared` and `core` modules in an Angular project?

- **`SharedModule`**: This module typically contains components, directives, and pipes that are shared across multiple feature modules. It’s imported into other modules to promote reusability.
- **`CoreModule`**: This module contains singleton services and components that are used globally within the app (like authentication services). It’s often imported only once, typically in the `AppModule`, to ensure global availability.
