# Top 30 Interview Questions and Answers on Data Binding in Angular

## 1. What is Data Binding in Angular?
**Answer:** Data binding in Angular is the synchronization between the model (business logic) and the view (UI). It helps connect the component’s data to the DOM and vice-versa. Angular uses two-way data binding, allowing for automatic data reflection between a model and a UI element.

## 2. What are the types of Data Binding in Angular?
**Answer:** Angular supports four types of data binding:
- **Interpolation** (one-way): Binds data from the TypeScript component to the template view.
- **Property Binding** (one-way): Binds the values from the TypeScript component to the property of an HTML element.
- **Event Binding** (one-way): Binds an event from the HTML element to a method in the component.
- **Two-way Data Binding**: Combines property and event binding, where changes in the UI reflect in the component and vice versa.

## 3. What is Interpolation in Angular?
**Answer:** Interpolation is one-way data binding that binds data from the component to the template (view). It uses the `{{}}` double curly braces syntax to insert values dynamically from the component.

Example:
```html
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
```
Here, the `title` property from the component is displayed inside the `h1` element.

## 4. How does Property Binding differ from Interpolation?
**Answer:** Interpolation binds data from the component to the DOM inside the HTML content, while Property Binding binds data to HTML element properties such as attributes, classes, or styles.

Example:
```html
<img [src]="imageUrl" alt="Image">
```

## 5. What is Event Binding?
**Answer:** Event binding allows the template to respond to user events such as clicks, keypresses, or form submissions. It uses the `()` syntax to bind events from the DOM to the component method.

Example:
```html
<button (click)="onClick()">Click me</button>
```

## 6. Explain Two-way Data Binding in Angular.
**Answer:** Two-way data binding allows for the synchronization of data between the model and the view. Angular uses `ngModel` directive for two-way data binding, which combines property binding and event binding.

Example:
```html
<input [(ngModel)]="username">
```

## 7. What directive is used for two-way data binding in Angular?
**Answer:** The `ngModel` directive is used for two-way data binding in Angular. It binds the input field's value to a component variable and updates the component when the input field changes.

## 8. How does the `ngModel` directive work internally?
**Answer:** Internally, `ngModel` uses property binding to set the initial value of an element and event binding to listen for changes. It combines both to achieve two-way data binding.

Syntax:
```html
[(ngModel)] = "modelProperty"
```

## 9. Can two-way data binding be achieved without `ngModel`?
**Answer:** Yes, by combining property binding and event binding, we can manually implement two-way data binding without `ngModel`.

Example:
```html
<input [value]="username" (input)="username=$event.target.value">
```

## 10. What is Banana in a Box notation in Angular?
**Answer:** The `[( )]` syntax used for two-way data binding is called Banana in a Box notation. The parentheses `( )` represent event binding, and the square brackets `[ ]` represent property binding. Together, they provide two-way binding.

## 11. What is the difference between Property Binding and Attribute Binding?
**Answer:** Property binding binds to the DOM properties of an HTML element, while attribute binding sets the attributes of the HTML element itself. Angular prefers property binding for performance reasons.

Example of Property Binding:
```html
<input [value]="username">
```

Example of Attribute Binding:
```html
<button [attr.disabled]="isDisabled ? true : null">Submit</button>
```

## 12. What is the role of `@Input()` in Angular?
**Answer:** `@Input()` is a decorator that allows a parent component to bind values to a child component's property. This supports property binding between components.

Example:
```ts
@Input() user: string;
```

## 13. What is the role of `@Output()` in Angular?
**Answer:** `@Output()` is a decorator that allows a child component to emit events to the parent component. This is typically used for event binding between components.

Example:
```ts
@Output() userChanged = new EventEmitter<string>();
```

## 14. What is the difference between `@Input()` and `@Output()`?
**Answer:** `@Input()` allows the parent component to send data to the child component (data binding). In contrast, `@Output()` allows the child component to emit events to the parent component (event binding).

## 15. Can we bind to a native element's style and class in Angular?
**Answer:** Yes, Angular provides `[ngStyle]` and `[ngClass]` directives for binding to an element’s inline styles and CSS classes.

Example for `ngStyle`:
```html
<div [ngStyle]="{'background-color': bgColor}">Styled Div</div>
```

Example for `ngClass`:
```html
<div [ngClass]="{'active': isActive, 'disabled': !isActive}">Class Binding</div>
```

## 16. What is the difference between `ngClass` and `ngStyle`?
**Answer:** `ngClass` is used to bind a set of CSS classes to an element dynamically, while `ngStyle` is used to bind inline styles.

## 17. What is an Angular Event Emitter?
**Answer:** `EventEmitter` is a class in Angular that allows for emitting custom events. It is often used with `@Output()` to allow child components to send data back to the parent components.

## 18. Can we bind to custom events in Angular?
**Answer:** Yes, using `@Output()` along with `EventEmitter`, we can emit custom events from one component and bind to those events in another component.

Example:
```ts
@Output() onCustomEvent = new EventEmitter();
```

## 19. How do you create a custom two-way data binding in Angular?
**Answer:** To create a custom two-way binding, you need to combine `@Input()` and `@Output()`. The `@Input()` property is used to pass data to the component, and the `@Output()` event is used to emit the changes.

## 20. What is Change Detection in Angular?
**Answer:** Change Detection is the mechanism that Angular uses to synchronize the model (component data) with the view (template). Angular constantly monitors component data and updates the DOM when any changes are detected.

## 21. What is the `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook?
**Answer:** `ngOnChanges` is a lifecycle hook called when any data-bound property of a directive or component changes. It is mainly used with `@Input()` properties to track changes.

## 22. What are Angular Pipes, and how are they used with data binding?
**Answer:** Pipes are used to transform data in the template. For example, they can format numbers, dates, or text. Angular provides built-in pipes like `| date`, `| currency`, and you can also create custom pipes.

Example:
```html
{{ price | currency }}
```

## 23. Can `ngModel` work without FormsModule?
**Answer:** No, `ngModel` is part of Angular’s FormsModule, and it must be imported into the module for it to work.

## 24. What is the `defaultValue` for input fields in Angular forms?
**Answer:** In Angular, the `defaultValue` is determined by the value provided by the component through property binding or initialization in the form.

## 25. How does Angular handle checkbox data binding?
**Answer:** Angular handles checkbox data binding by binding the `checked` property for one-way binding and using `[(ngModel)]` for two-way binding.

Example:
```html
<input type="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="isChecked">
```

## 26. What are Safe Navigation Operators in Angular?
**Answer:** The Safe Navigation Operator (`?.`) is used in Angular templates to prevent errors when accessing properties on objects that may be `null` or `undefined`.

## 27. What is Dynamic Data Binding in Angular?
**Answer:** Dynamic data binding refers to binding data to the view dynamically at runtime. In Angular, this is typically achieved using directives like `ngFor` or `ngIf`.

## 28. What is a Template Expression?
**Answer:** Template expressions are used within interpolation `{{}}` in Angular to display data. They can include property access, mathematical expressions, or method invocations from the component.

## 29. What is the difference between Binding and Directives in Angular?
**Answer:** Data binding is about connecting the model (component data) and the view (template). Directives, on the other hand, are instructions that modify the DOM and affect the layout or behavior of DOM elements.

## 30. Can Angular handle dynamic binding of multiple attributes?
**Answer:** Yes, Angular can dynamically bind multiple attributes using directives like `ngStyle` and `ngClass`, or by applying property binding for each attribute.
